    "Abstract\n",
    "The accurate identification of medicinal plants plays a crucial role in ensuring the effective use of plant-based remedies in healthcare. \n",
    "This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for the identification of medicinal plants using image processing techniques. \n",
    "A dataset of segmented medicinal leaf images was utilized to train a MobileNetV2 deep learning model, achieving high accuracy in plant classification. \n",
    "The proposed solution integrates a Flask-based web application for real-time plant identification. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the \n",
    "system in predicting medicinal plant species with high confidence levels, paving the way for automated plant recognition systems in healthcare and research.\n",

    "Keywords: Medicinal plants, image processing, machine learning, MobileNetV2, Flask, plant identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Medicinal plants have been integral to traditional medicine for centuries, and their accurate identification is vital for their effective use in pharmacology and healthcare. \n",
    "Traditional methods of identification are labor-intensive and require domain expertise. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and image processing provide a potential automated solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study proposes a machine learning-based approach using the MobileNetV2 model for the classification and identification of medicinal plants. \n",
    "The web-based system provides real-time predictions, enhancing usability for researchers and healthcare professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, comprising segmented images of medicinal plant leaves. \n",
    "The images were preprocessed to ensure uniformity in size and format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Model\n",
    "The MobileNetV2 architecture was selected for its balance between performance and computational efficiency. \n",
    "The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset to classify plant species based on leaf images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 System Design\n",
    "The system comprises the following components:\n",
    "- Model Training: Conducted in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.\n",
    "- Web Application: Implemented using Flask for real-time interaction with users.\n",
    "- Frontend Interface: Allows users to upload leaf images and view predictions with confidence scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 Workflow\n",
    "1. Input: Users upload an image of a plant leaf.\n",
    "2. Processing: The trained MobileNetV2 model classifies the image.\n",
    "3. Output: The system displays the predicted plant species along with the confidence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Results and Discussion\n",
    "The MobileNetV2 model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. The web application demonstrated real-time classification capabilities, \n",
    "with an average prediction time of Y seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "This project presents a novel application of machine learning techniques for the identification of medicinal plants. \n",
    "The integration of a Flask-based web interface makes the system accessible and user-friendly. \n",
    "Future work includes expanding the plant database, improving model accuracy, and incorporating additional features such as detailed plant information retrieval through a REST API.\n",
